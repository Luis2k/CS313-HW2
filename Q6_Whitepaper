Question 6:
Use a stack to pass in a string and reverse each word in the string. For instance, if you have the string 
“​When Chuck Norris falls in water, Chuck Norris doesn't get wet. Water gets Chuck Norris.​” It should now say, 
“​nehW kcuhC sirroN sllaf ni retaw, ...​” That is, it
should take in one string and be a function (or multiple functions) that use a stack (or multiple stacks)
to reverse each word in the sentence. Create a text file that you input of Chuck Norris jokes and have the 
program reverse each of the jokes. [Here is some help if you want ot teg detracts.

-read from input file
-line by line, a string would be reversed however just the word not the whole string
-using stack
-writes to output file

main()->Q6():
-the input file is open as well as the output
-using while loop to go through input file line by line
-writes to output file the reverse of the string
-closes output and input files

reverse():
-returns the string that will be written into the output file
-this function goes through the entire string in the for loop
-to group characters that form a word in the for loop it checks if the current character is a space, comma, period, quotation
-while is there no such character then the other characters are pushed into the stack
-once there is a separation between character it indicates a word
-once this is determined in the else if statement, a function to reverse that word is called
-the function is also called if it is the last word in the string 
-returns the modified string 

reverseword():
-using the position of current character in string subtracted by the size of the word
-the position of the first character is equal to the top of the stack
-letter count of word is reset back to zero
