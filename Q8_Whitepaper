Question 8:
Company X generally processes orders based on a first come, first serve basis.
Sometimes a client will ask for rush processing and will be awarded a number based on the urgency. If they pay extra they will receive a 3 priority, if they have a bulk order they will receive a 2 priority, and if they know someone in the company and ask for a favor they will receive the highest priority, a 1. Design a system that accepts orders from clients and processes these orders based on no priority or somewhere on the priority scale. Show how the system will work for random orders with a random processing time.

Q8():
-priority queue 
-a random order generator 
-pushes order into queue
-prints queue

order class:
-created to have a data type that stores name of the client, and priority
-also assigns the priority level by using a switch statement
	-p: If they pay extra they will receive a 3 priority
	-b: if they have a bulk order they will receive a 2
	-f: if they know someone in the company and ask for a favor they will 	    receive the highest priority, a 1
	-n: no priority 
-parameters are the characters that represent the priority and a name
-has getName to return "name" of client
-has getPriority to return priority

operator<:
-overloads operator in order to compare the order's priority levels and make sure the lowest number has the highest priority in the queue 

orderGen():
-used to create fake clients with different priority levels
-these are then pushed into the queue
